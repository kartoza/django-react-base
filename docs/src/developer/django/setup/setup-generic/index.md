## Generic Developer Setup

This section of the documentation is designed to guide developers step by step through the process of setting up a development workstation.

> ⭐️ Before running these generic steps, make sure you have completed the operating system specific steps available [here](../index.md).

To get started, ensure that both **Docker** and **Git** are installed on your system. Begin with the **Prerequisites** section.

Once the operating system specific steps are complete, continue with the following steps which apply to any OS:

* [Cloning the repo](cloning.md)
* [Configuration](configuration.md)
* [Running Locally](./run/index.md)
* [🚩 Removing](./removing.md)

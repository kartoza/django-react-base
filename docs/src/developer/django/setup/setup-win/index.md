For windows development setup, we will use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
to run the development environment. This allows us to run a Linux distribution
on Windows, which is more compatible with the tools and libraries used in
django application.

## WSL2

WSL2 is needed to run linux environment in Windows. Follow step by step below
to install WSL2.

Open Powershell as Administrator

![image.png](./img/wsl-1.png)

Install wsl2 with below command

```bash
wsl --install
```

![image.png](./img/wsl-2.png)

Once completed, you need to restart the machine. You can check if the
installation is completed successfully by checking the list of installed
distribution from the Powershell.

```bash
wsl --list
```

By default, the Ubuntu is chosen and installed after running the first command.
However if there is no distribution that is installed like image below, we can
then install it manually.

![image.png](./img/wsl-3.png)

To list all the available distribution, we can run command:

```bash
wsl --list --online
```

The results:

```bash
The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.

NAME                            FRIENDLY NAME

OracleLinux_8_7                 Oracle Linux 8.7
OracleLinux_9_1                 Oracle Linux 9.1
```

We will use the latest Ubuntu version, 24.04 LTS. To install it, run command:

```bash
wsl --install Ubuntu-24.04
```

Once ubuntu is installed, we can setup the user account for Ubuntu. Search for
ubuntu from the search bar and click Open to run it.

![image.png](./img/wsl-5.png)

It will open a terminal where you can setup username and password for your
Ubuntu.

After your user account is created, you will see below image that indicates the
installation is successful.

![image.png](./img/wsl-7.png)

You should update your system after this by running command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Install Git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

## (Optional) SSH Setup

The SSH are preferred when fetching and pushing codes to GitHub. Please
follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
to generate SSH key pair and add it into your GitHub account.

## (Optional) GPG Setup

GPG signing keys are used to sign the commits. WSL2 can use the keys from
Windows by
following [this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/matthiasr/473072eeffe449459e3ccd0f5192afc7).
Next, we need to update the configuration inside WSL2, edit or create if this
file does not exist: `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

```bash
default-cache-ttl 34560000
max-cache-ttl 34560000
pinentry-program "/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/GnuPG/bin/pinentry-basic.exe"
```

It is recommended to explicitly restart the gpg agent to force these changes.
Alternatively, restart Windows at this point.

```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

Once the key is generated, please
follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
to add it into your GitHub account.

## Docker Setup

Follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#overview-of-docker-containers)
to install docker desktop that integrates with WSL2. After docker is installed
and running, we recommend to disable the `Resource Saver` feature as it may
cause unexpected issue during development.

## Install VSCode

Follow the installation steps
from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) to setup the
VSCode on Windows. The VSCode CLI will also be installed in the WSL2 and you
can check by running below command in the WSL2 Ubuntu terminal.

```bash
code --version
```

It will return output like below:

```bash
1.100.2
848b80aeb52026648a8ff9f7c45a9b0a80641e2e
x64
```

## Next Steps

> 🪧 Now that you have the docker, move on to the generic workflow, starting
> with [Cloning](../setup-generic/cloning.md).
